# Machine-Architecture-and-Organization
Course Project from University of Minnesota CSCI 2021
### Project 1: C Programming
#### Banlet Support
 - Prints messages as "banner letters" which are larger and more striking than standard terminal fonts.
#### Completing Banlet
 - Combine several of the support functions from Problem 1 and implement a font-loading function in order to complete the Banlet program
#### Tree Maps in C
 - Implements a rudimentary "tree map" application in C which features a library of tree manipulation functions and a "main" application that provides a command line interface to them.

### Project 2: Bit Ops and Debugging
#### Battery Meter Simulation
 - A voltage sensor whose value can be accessed via a memory mapped port. In C this is presented as a global variable. Another port indicates whether the voltage should be displayed in Volts or Percentage of total battery capacity.
 - A digital display with a port control port; setting certain global variable will change the display to show information to a user of the battery meter.
 - Update the display based on the sensor value.
#### Debugging the Puzzlebox
 - Use gdb The GNU Debugger

### Project 3: Assembly Coding and Debugging
#### Battery Meter Assembly Functions
 - Write the functions in x86-64 assembly code from P2

#### The Binary Bomb
 - There is a program called bomb which expects certain inputs from a parameter file or typed as input. If the inputs are "correct", a phase will be "defused" earning points and allowing access to a subsequent phases. The major change is that the bomb program is in binary so must be debugged in assembly.

### Project 4: Performance Optimization and Timing
#### Matrix Diagonal Sums
 - write sumdiag_OPTM() which is a faster version of the provided sumdiag_BASE() to calculate the sums of diagonals.

#### Timing Search Algorithms
 - Timing several algorithms to measure their performance

### Project 5: Binary ELF File Parsing
 - Findfunc: Finding Functions in ELF Files
